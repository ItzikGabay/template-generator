# üèì Template Generator Cloning Tool

Introducing an new package cloning tool, designed for developers who need to quickly and easily clone packages from Git repositories or local folders.

Whether you're working with popular packages like Next.js or other custom packages,
this app provides a seamless and efficient way to clone the package's contents.

With its ability to clone the package without the Git history and repository,
you can keep your local environment clean and free from unnecessary clutter.

With this CLI, you'll have everything you need to get started with your project in no time.
